	In index.php page u have a static filter box..u can change those values directly .When u select a value i it ,it automatically post that values to "filters.php"  and get the coreseponding filters.

	Similarly,when u select a value in next filter box ,it post that value to "tech.php" and it return a json object.write ur own logic in tech.php to retrive filters.
	An then profile.php,it is just a static page .u can change the values using php variables.
